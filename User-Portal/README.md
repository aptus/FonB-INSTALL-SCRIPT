FonB User Portal
==================
1. Assuming that you installed your backend on the system with IP 10.0.8.10 and configured port 8080 for access while installation, you can now access the User Portal by accessing 10.0.8.10:8080. Here you will see the License Inventory available in your FonB. The inventory is empty for the newly installed systems.

2. If you are on the license page after the fresh installation, you will have to visit Aptus FonB Download Page and register for a 30 days trial license.

3. Fill in and submit the registration form, to receive an email providing all the necessary information along with the license activation key.

4. Copy this license key and paste it in FonB License Inventory Page you are seeing everytime you try to access 10.0.8.10:8080.

5. Press the Activate License button to activate your product and start your 30 days trial period.

6. You will be redirected to the Login Screen. Use the credentials you provided while installation to login. 

7. Start using FonB User Portal.
